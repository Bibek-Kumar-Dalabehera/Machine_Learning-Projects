# Machine Learning Projects - Flask Applications
**Welcome to my repository of 5 end-to-end machine learning projects, each integrated with a Flask web app for easy user interaction. Below you'll find details on each project, including the purpose, tech stack, how to use the application, and how to set it up locally.**

### Projects Overview
**1. Book Recommendation System** <br>
Description: Recommends books based on user preferences and previous choices.<br>
Tech Stack: Flask, Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering.<br>
Key Features: User can search for books and get personalized recommendations. Includes options for filtering by genre or author.
<br><br>
**2. Movie Recommendation System**
Description: Provides personalized movie recommendations based on user input.<br>
Tech Stack: Flask, Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering.<br>
Key Features: Users can input their favorite movies, and the system suggests similar ones.
<br><br>
**3. House Price Prediction**
Description: Predicts house prices based on various features like location, size, and number of rooms.<br>
Tech Stack: Flask, Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Linear Regression.<br>
Key Features: Users can input details about a house and get an estimated price. Visualization of predicted vs. actual prices.
<br><br>
**4. SMS Spam Detection**
Description: Classifies SMS messages as spam or not spam using natural language processing.<br>
Tech Stack: Flask, Python, Scikit-learn, Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), Logistic Regression.<br>
Key Features: Users can input a text message and get an instant spam detection result. Includes model accuracy metrics.
<br><br>
**5. Iris Flower Classification**
Description: Classifies iris flowers into one of three species based on petal and sepal measurements.<br>
Tech Stack: Flask, Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).<br>
Key Features: Users can input flower <br>measurements and receive a species classification.
<br><br>
**6. Dibeties Disease Prediction**
Description: Predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user input such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.<br>
Tech Stack: Flask, Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier.<br>
Key Features: Takes medical input parameters from the user and predicts heart disease risk. Provides an intuitive interface and displays prediction results clearly. <br>
